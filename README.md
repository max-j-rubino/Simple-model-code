# Simple-model-code
 
This model has no input data, and should run on it's own. 

The objective of this model is to evaluate the tradeoff between accepting low-quality food, or skipping it and searching for higher-quality food. Larger animals need more food and thus are more likely to gamble and skip low-quality food. Smaller animals can get enough calories from low-quality food to grow and are less likely to skip low-quality food. 

Parameter values for this model could be changed to represent different species. This model is intended to be generic, and the parameters chosen do not represent any real animal. 

This code should produce an output file. That is then loaded using the same Rscript. These output files could be sourced directly into R as well.
